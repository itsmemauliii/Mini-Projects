# Glass Profile Card with Glowing Effects

This project demonstrates the creation of a sleek glass profile card with glowing effects using HTML and CSS. The glass effect combined with subtle glowing animations adds a modern and stylish touch to user profiles on websites or applications.

## Project Description

The glass profile card is a popular UI design element that brings depth and elegance to user interfaces. With the rising trend of glassmorphism in web design, this project provides a practical implementation of creating a glass-like profile card using HTML and CSS.

## Key features of the project include:-

- **Glass Effect**: The profile card incorporates a glass-like transparency effect achieved through CSS properties such as `background-blur` and `box-shadow`, creating a visually appealing aesthetic.
  
- **Glowing Effects**: To enhance the visual appeal, the profile card includes subtle glowing effects on the edges and certain elements using CSS `box-shadow` and `animation` properties. These glowing animations add a captivating touch to the design without overwhelming the user.

- **Customizable Content**: The profile card's content, including the user's name, job title, and profile picture, is easily customizable. Users can replace the default content with their own information to personalize the profile card for their needs.

- **Responsive Design**: The profile card is designed to be responsive, ensuring that it displays optimally across various screen sizes and devices. CSS media queries are used to adjust the layout and styling based on the viewport size, providing a seamless user experience across different devices.
